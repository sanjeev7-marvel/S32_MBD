    @defgroup phy Ethernet Transciever (PHY)
    The S32 SDK provides a peripheral driver for some of the Ethernet Transcievers on the supported devices.

    ## Hardware background ##

    One of the devices supported by the current framework is TJA1100.
    The TJA1100 is a 100BASE-T1 compliant Ethernet PHY optimized for automotive use
    cases. The device provides 100 Mbit/s transmit and receive capability over a single
    Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cable, supporting a cable length of up to at least 15 m.
    Optimized for automotive use cases such as IP camera links, driver assistance systems
    and back-bone networks, the TJA1100 has been designed to minimize power
    consumption and system costs, while still providing the robustness required for
    automotive use cases.

    ## How to use the PHY framework in your application ##
    
    In order to use the PHY framework in your application, the framework needs to be initialized by calling
    the <b>PHY_FrameworkInit()</b> function. The parameters of this function specify:
        - an array of PHY configuration structures;
        - an array of pointers to the PHY drivers used by the application.
    
    The configuration of the PHY is specified through the <b>phy_config_t</b> structure and contains:
        - the PHY driver type used by the current PHY - will refer to an index in the array of drivers (<b>phyDrivers</b>);
        - the address of the PHY;
        - the location (internal/external);
        - the role (master/slave);
        - the instance number of the ENET module connected to this PHY;
        - the callbacks associated with different events (link up/down, autonegotiation complete, autonegotiation failed).
    
    The driver structure (<b>phy_driver_t</b>) represents a set of functions used to control the module and must be compatible with the
    associated device. Currently, the following drivers are implemented:
        - TJA110x (<b>PHY_driver_tja110x</b>);
        - generic driver, supporting IEEE standardized registers (<b>PHY_driver_generic</b>).

## Integration guideline ##
 
### Compilation units ###

The following files need to be compiled in the project:

${S32SDK_PATH}\platform\drivers\src\phy\phy_generic.c
${S32SDK_PATH}\platform\drivers\src\phy\phy_tja110x.c
\endverbatim

### Include path ###

The following paths need to be added to the include path of the toolchain:
\verbatim
${S32SDK_PATH}\platform\drivers\inc\
\endverbatim

### Compile symbols ###

No special symbols are required for this component

### Dependencies ###
